TO DO
===================================

Fix bug no.1

Add a 'blank' option on the 3d number wheels!
	Currently the options are 0 - 9

Make 3d camera automatically animate to correct distance from meshes
	This will be needed when the number of banana pack sizes increases

Add reset button for 3d scene and html form

Chain animations so that 3d text labels appear after crates appear

Make 3d text label animations fade in/out


BUGS
